/// pqUndoStackBuilder extends the vtkSMUndoStackBuilder as follows:
/// \li If properties on registered proxies are changed when the builder is not
/// with a BeginOrContinueUndoSet - EndUndoSet block, unless 
/// IgnoreIsolatedChanges is true, it will create a UndoSet with that change 
/// alone and push it on the stack. IgnoreIsolatedChanges does not have any 
/// effect in a BeginOrContinueUndoSet-EndUndoSet block.
/// \li pqProxy objects can be added to be ignored for all changes. Thus,
/// any change event triggered from any of the proxies in the ignore list
/// don't result in updating of the undo stack even when those changes happen
/// with a BeginOrContinueUndoSet - EndUndoSet block (this feature isn't 
/// implemented currently).
/// With these extensions, following are the points we must remember to ensure
/// that Undo/Redo works.
/// \li For any multi-change operations or proxy creation/registration 
///     operations such as creating of a source/reader/filter etc. we must 
///     explicitly use Begin() and End() blocks.
/// \li For modal dialogs which change a bunch of properties when the user 
///     hits Ok, such as Application Settings dialog, change input dialogs, 
///     we must use Begin() and End().
/// \li Any GUI wiget that is a single widget but changes multiple server 
///     manager properties or can lead to mutiple undo steps should use 
///     Begin and End block eg. Accept button, widget to select scalar to color 
///     by etc.
/// \li GUI Widgets that are directly linked to a Server Manager property and 
///     don't need to be accepted, don't need to worry about Undo/Redo at all.
///     The pqUndoStackBuilder will automatically create elements for such 
///     changes and even try to given them friendly labels eg. most Animation 
///     panel properties, display panel widgets etc.
/// Currently, this class automatically adds property modifications alone to 
/// the stack. We may want to explore the possibility of automatically adding 
/// all types of server manager modifications to the stack.
