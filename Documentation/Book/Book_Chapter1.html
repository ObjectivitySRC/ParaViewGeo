                extensive scripting and batch processing capabilities. The standard
                scripting interface uses the widely used python programming
                language for scripted control. As with the GUI, the python scripted
                control is easy to learn, including the ability to record
                actions in the GUI and save them out as succinct human readable
                python programs. It is also powerful, with the ability to write
                scripted filters that run on the server that have access to every
                bit of your data on a large parallel machine. </FONT></FONT>

                <FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>ParaView's data
                processing and rendering components are built upon a modular and
                scalable distributed-memory parallel architecture in which many
                processors operate synchronously on different portions of the data.
                ParaView's scalable architecture allows you to run ParaView
                directly on anything from a small netbook class machine up to the
                world's largest supercomputer. However, the size of the datasets ParaView can
                handle in practice though varies widely depending on the size of
                the machine that ParaView's server components are run on. Thus people
                frequently do both, taking advantage of ParaView's client/server
                architecture to connect to and control the supercomputer from the

                        thing to keep in mind when using ParaView is that the GUI is very
                        modal. At any given time you will have one &quot;active&quot;
                        module within the visualization pipeline, one &quot;active&quot;
                        view, and one &quot;active&quot; selection. For example when you
                        click on the name of a reader or source within the Pipeline
                        Browser, it becomes the active module and the properties of that
                        filter are displayed in the Object Inspector. Likewise when you
                        click within a different view, that view becomes the active view
                        and the visibility &quot;eye&quot; icons in the Pipeline Browser
                        are changed to show what filters are displayed within this View.
                        These concepts will be described in detail in later chapters
                        <A HREF="http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Displaying_Data#Multiple_Views">[0]</A><A HREF="http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/UsersGuide/Filtering_Data#Pipeline_Basics">[1]</A><A HREF="http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Selection">[2]</A>.

                a better cognitive understanding of our data. Scientific
                visualization is specifically concerned with the type of data that
                has a well-defined representation in 2D or 3D space. Data that
                comes from simulation meshes and scanner data is well suited for

                any number of filters that process the data to generate, extract,
                or derive features from the data. Finally, a viewable image is
                rendered from the data and you can then change the viewing

                <FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once a file is read,
                ParaView automatically renders it in a view. In ParaView, a view is
                simply a window that shows data. There are different types of
                views, ranging from qualitative computer graphics rendering of the
                data to quantitative spreadsheet presentations of the data values
                as text. ParaView picks a suitable view type for your data
                automatically, but you are free to change the view type, modify the
                rendering parameters of the data in the view, and even create new
                views simultaneously as you see fit to better understand what

                including ones with multiple readers, merging and branching
                pipelines. You build up a pipeline by choosing the next filter in
                the sequence from the Filters menu. Once you click accept, this new

                transforms your data into the required format. In ParaView 3.10
                you can ask ParaView to try to do the conversion for you
                automatically, by clicking &quot;Auto convert properties&quot; in

                The mechanics of applying filters are described fully in the

                <FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Frequently, new users
                of ParaView falter when they open their data, or apply a filter,
                and do not see it immediately because they have not pressed the
                Apply button. ParaView was designed to operate on large datasets,
                for which any given operation could take a long time
                to finish. In
                this situation you need the Apply button so that
                you have a chance to be confident of your change before it takes
                effect. The highlighted Apply button is a reminder that the
                parameters of one or more filters are out of sync with the data
                that you are viewing. Hitting the Apply button accepts your change
                (or changes) whereas hitting the Reset button reverts the options
                back to the last time you hit Apply. If you are working with small
                datasets, you may want to turn off this behavior with the Auto
                Accept setting under the Application <A HREF="http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Users_Guide/Settings">Settings</A>.

                find that you are not satisfied with the result, hit the Undo
                button. You can undo all the way back to the start of your ParaView
                session and redo all the way forward if you like. You can also undo
                and redo camera motion by using the camera undo and redo buttons

                you are satisfied with your visualization results, you may want to
                save your work so that you can return to it at some future time.
                You can do so by using ParaView's Save State ("File"|Save State)
                and Save Trace ("Tools"|Save Trace) features. In either case,
                ParaView produces human readable text files (XML files for State
                and Python script for Trace) that can be restored or modified and
                restored later. This is very useful for batch processing, which is
                discussed in the <A HREF="http://paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView/Python_Scripting">Python

                to save enough information about the ParaView session to restore it
                later and thus show exactly the same result. ParaView does so by
                saving the current visualization pipeline and parameters of the
                filters within it. </FONT></FONT>

                <FONT FACE="DejaVu Serif, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If you turn on a
                trace recording when you first start using ParaView, saving a trace
                can be used for the same purpose as saving state. However, a trace
                records all of your actions, including the ones that you later
                undo, as you do them. It is a more exact recording of not only
                what you did, but how you did it. Traces are saved as python
                scripts, which ParaView can play back in either batch mode or
                within an interactive GUI session. You can therefore use traces then to
                automate repetitive tasks by recording just that action. It is also
                an ideal tool to learn ParaView's python scripting API. </FONT></FONT>

                single machine is not likely to have enough processing power and
                much more importantly memory to process the data. In this situation

                rendering tasks and then connect to that server within the

                word 'builtin' which indicates that you are connected to a virtual
                server residing in the same process as the GUI. When connected to a
                remote server, the File Open dialog presents the list of files that
                live on the remote machine's file system rather than the client's.
