GeoTIFF Development Kit
-----------------------

This is intended to be a very simple binary distribution of the 
libraries needed to build GeoTIFF applications using libtiff and
libgeotiff on Win32.

o Requires MS Visual C++ or compatible tools

o Add geotiff_dev/include to your include path. 

o Add geotiff_dev/lib/geotiff_i.lib and geotiff_dev/lib/libtiff_i.lib
  to your link.

o Include geotiff_dev/bin/geotiff.dll and geotiff_dev/bin/libtiff.dll
  to your path. 

A simple example build is demonstrated in geotiff_dev/example using
the build.bat file. 

Good luck!
